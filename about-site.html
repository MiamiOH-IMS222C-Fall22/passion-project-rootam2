    <h2>About The Auther</h2>
    <p> <strong>Hello, my name is Ashley and I am currently a student at Miami University.  I am studying Emerging Technology 
    in Business and Design at the College of Creative Arts.  I am involved in club field hcokey, MUFD (Miami University 
    Fashion and Design), and Greek Gathering.  I am from Hudson, Ohio which is near Cleveland.  I have a passion for 
    all things fashion whether it be on social media or in life. </strong></p>

    <h2>Why Start This Site</h2>
    <p><strong>I started this site because I want to inform the fashion industry of the negative impact of fast fashion.
        I decided to create a website that will present brands that are involved in fast fashion, information about fast 
        fashion, how to prevent it, etcâ€¦. What I want to accomplish with this site is to slow the production or even stop 
        fast fashion.  With more information out in the world, the more the public will be aware of this issue.</strong></p>
